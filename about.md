I am Romee Zhou (Chinese name Yuchen Zhou), a junior student from NYU Shanghai majoring in CS and minoring in Philosophy. And I have a binary birthday, 011011, suitable for CS major. 

One more thing about me is that I am also fond of art. I paint sometimes, though not professionally. So a great thing that I am looking forward to would be combining the fields that I am interested in together in the future.
